#           (should only be known by the device, and kept secret)
#       2. ${PROJECT_NAME}-device_id.csr.pem - the certificate signing request
#          (you can delete this file, you wonâ€™t need it once the certificate has been signed)
#       3. ${PROJECT_NAME}-device_id.crt.pem - the public key (certificate) for the device.
#          This is what the device should present to the Golioth server as a client certificate.
