config GOLIOTH_DEBUG_LOG
    bool "Enable internal debug logs"
    default y
    help
        Enable/disable GLTH_LOGX log statements.

        If disabled, then the GLTH_LOGX macros will
        be removed/undefined.

config GOLIOTH_AUTO_LOG_TO_CLOUD
    bool "Enable automatic logging to Golioth"
    default y
    help
        Enable/disable automatic logging to Golioth for GLTH_LOGX statements

        If enabled, GLTH_LOGX statements will log to stdout as well as to
        Golioth. If disabled, they will only go to stdout.

        Enabling can result is a large amount of data transmitted to Golioth,
        so use with caution.

        If you enable this, it might be a good idea to increase
        GOLIOTH_COAP_REQUEST_QUEUE_MAX_ITEMS, since there will be many
        more CoAP requests (one per GLTH_LOGX statement). Otherwise you
        will see warnings like "Failed to enqueue request, queue full".

        There is an internal feature flag that is set by default to the value of this
        configuration item. The flag can also be set at runtime.

config GOLIOTH_DEBUG_DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL
    int "Default log level for Golioth SDK"
    default 3
    help
        The default log level, which is used to filter GLTH_LOGX statements.

        0: None
        1: Error
        2: Warn
        3: Info
        4: Debug
        5: Verbose

        This value can be overriden at runtime with golioth_debug_set_log_level().
