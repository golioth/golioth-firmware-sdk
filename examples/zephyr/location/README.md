# Golioth location sample

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to use cell tower and / or Wi-Fi access
point information to stream device position to any destination using
[Golioth
Location](https://docs.golioth.io/application-services/location/) and
[Pipelines](https://docs.golioth.io/data-routing).

> [!NOTE]
> To successfully deliver device position to a destination, you must
> have an appropriate Pipeline configured in your Golioth project. This
> example works with the Golioth Location Pipelines examples in the
> [documentation](https://docs.golioth.io/data-routing/examples/location).

## Requirements

* Golioth credentials
* Network connectivity

## Building and Running

### Runtime Configuration

#### PSK based auth

We provide an option for setting Golioth credentials through the Zephyr
shell. This is based on the Zephyr Settings subsystem.

At runtime, configure PSK-ID and PSK using the device shell based on your
Golioth credentials:

```sh
uart:~$ settings set golioth/psk-id <my-psk-id@my-project>
uart:~$ settings set golioth/psk <my-psk>
uart:-$ kernel reboot cold
```

#### WiFi Configuration

Devices that use WiFi get their WiFi credentials from the settings subsystem.
You can set the credentials with the following shell commands:

```sh
uart:~$ settings set wifi/ssid <ssid>
uart:~$ settings set wifi/psk <wifi-password>
uart:-$ kernel reboot cold
```

### Platform specific configuration

#### Native Simulator

This application has been built and tested with Native Simulator
(native_sim).

On your Linux host computer, open a terminal window, locate the source
code of this sample application (i.e., `examples/zephyr/location`)
and type:

```console
$ west build -b native_sim examples/zephyr/location
$ west build -t run
```

#### ESP32-DevKitC-WROVER

On your host computer open a terminal window, locate the source code of
this sample application (i.e., `examples/zephyr/location`) and type:

```console
$ west build -b esp32_devkitc_wrover/esp32/procpu examples/zephyr/location
$ west flash
```

#### nRF52840 DK + ESP32-WROOM-32

See [Golioth ESP-AT WiFi
Shield](../../../zephyr/boards/shields/golioth_esp_at/doc/index.md).

On your host computer open a terminal window, locate the source code of
this sample application (i.e., `examples/zephyr/location`) and type:

```console
$ west build -b nrf52840dk/nrf52840 --shield golioth_esp_at examples/zephyr/location
$ west flash
```

#### nRF9160 DK

On your host computer open a terminal window, locate the source code of
this sample application (i.e., `examples/zephyr/location`) and type:

```console
$ west build -b nrf9160dk/nrf9160/ns examples/zephyr/location
$ west flash
```
