# Golioth LightDB Delete Sample

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to connect to Golioth and delete values
from LigthDB.

## Requirements

* Golioth credentials
* Network connectivity

## Building and Running

Configure the following Kconfig options based on your Golioth
credentials:

* GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_PSK_ID - PSK ID of registered device
* GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_PSK - PSK of registered device

by adding these lines to configuration file (e.g. `prj.conf`):

```cfg
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_PSK_ID="my-psk-id"
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_PSK="my-psk"
```

### Platform specific configuration

#### QEMU

This application has been built and tested with QEMU x86 (qemu_x86).

On your Linux host computer, open a terminal window, locate the source
code of this sample application (i.e., `samples/lightdb/delete`) and
type:

```console
$ west build -b qemu_x86 samples/lightdb/delete
$ west build -t run
```

See [Networking with
QEMU](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.3.0/connectivity/networking/qemu_setup.html)
on how to setup networking on host and configure NAT/masquerading to
access Internet.

#### nRF52840 DK + ESP32-WROOM-32

This subsection documents using nRF52840 DK running Zephyr with
offloaded ESP-AT WiFi driver and ESP32-WROOM-32 module based board (such
as ESP32 DevkitC rev. 4) running WiFi stack. See [AT Binary
Lists](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-at/en/latest/AT_Binary_Lists/index.html)
for links to ESP-AT binaries and details on how to flash ESP-AT image on
ESP chip. Flash ESP chip with following command:

```console
esptool.py write_flash --verify 0x0 PATH_TO_ESP_AT/factory/factory_WROOM-32.bin
```

Connect nRF52840 DK and ESP32-DevKitC V4 (or other ESP32-WROOM-32 based
board) using wires:

| nRF52840 DK | ESP32-WROOM-32 |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| P1.01 (RX)  | IO17 (TX)      |
| P1.02 (TX)  | IO16 (RX)      |
| P1.03 (CTS) | IO14 (RTS)     |
| P1.04 (RTS) | IO15 (CTS)     |
| P1.05       | EN             |
| GND         | GND            |

Configure the following Kconfig options based on your WiFi AP
credentials:

* GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_SSID - WiFi SSID
* GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_PSK - WiFi PSK

by adding these lines to configuration file (e.g. `prj.conf` or
`board/nrf52840dk_nrf52840.conf`):

```cfg
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_SSID="my-wifi"
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_PSK="my-psk"
```

On your host computer open a terminal window, locate the source code of
this sample application (i.e., `samples/lightdb/delete`) and type:

```console
$ west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 samples/lightdb/delete
$ west flash
```

#### nRF9160 DK

On your host computer open a terminal window, locate the source code of
this sample application (i.e., `samples/ligthdb/delete`) and type:

```console
$ west build -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns samples/lightdb/delete
$ west flash
```

### Sample output

### Set counter value

The device retrieves the value stored at `/counter` in LightDB every 5
seconds. The value can be set with:

```console
goliothctl lightdb set <device-name> /counter -b "{\"counter\":34}"
```
