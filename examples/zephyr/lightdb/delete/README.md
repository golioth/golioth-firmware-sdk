# Golioth LightDB Delete Sample

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to connect to Golioth and delete values
from LightDB.

## Requirements

* Golioth credentials
* Network connectivity

## Building and Running

### Authentication specific configuration

#### PSK based auth - Hardcoded

Configure the following Kconfig options based on your Golioth
credentials:

* GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_PSK_ID - PSK ID of registered device
* GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_PSK - PSK of registered device

by adding these lines to configuration file (e.g. `prj.conf`):

```cfg
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_PSK_ID="my-psk-id"
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_PSK="my-psk"
```

#### PSK based auth - Runtime

We provide an option for setting Golioth credentials through the Zephyr
shell. This is based on the Zephyr Settings subsystem.

Enable the settings shell by including the following configuration overlay
file:

```sh
$ west build -- -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=../../common/runtime_settings.conf
```

Alternatively, you can add the following options to ``prj.conf``:

```cfg
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_HARDCODED_CREDENTIALS=n

CONFIG_FLASH=y
CONFIG_FLASH_MAP=y
CONFIG_NVS=y

CONFIG_SETTINGS=y
CONFIG_SETTINGS_RUNTIME=y
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_PSK_SETTINGS=y
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_SETTINGS=y
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_SETTINGS_AUTOLOAD=y
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_SETTINGS_SHELL=y
```

At runtime, configure PSK-ID and PSK using the device shell based on your
Golioth credentials:

```sh
uart:~$ settings set golioth/psk-id <my-psk-id@my-project>
uart:~$ settings set golioth/psk <my-psk>
uart:-$ kernel reboot cold
```

#### Certificate based auth

Configure the following Kconfig options based on your Golioth
credentials:

* CONFIG_GOLIOTH_AUTH_METHOD_CERT - use certificate-based
    authentication
* CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_HARDCODED_CRT_PATH - device certificate
* CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_HARDCODED_KEY_PATH - device private key

by adding these lines to configuration file (e.g. `prj.conf`):

```cfg
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_AUTH_METHOD_CERT=y
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_HARDCODED_CRT_PATH="keys/device.crt.der"
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_HARDCODED_KEY_PATH="keys/device.key.der"
```

### Platform specific configuration

#### QEMU

This application has been built and tested with QEMU x86 (qemu_x86).

On your Linux host computer, open a terminal window, locate the source
code of this sample application (i.e., `examples/zephyr/lightdb/delete`) and
type:

```console
$ west build -b qemu_x86 examples/zephyr/lightdb/delete
$ west build -t run
```

See [Networking with
QEMU](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.3.0/connectivity/networking/qemu_setup.html)
on how to setup networking on host and configure NAT/masquerading to
access Internet.

#### ESP32-DevKitC-WROVER

Configure the following Kconfig options based on your WiFi AP
credentials:

- GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_SSID  - WiFi SSID
- GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_PSK   - WiFi PSK

by adding these lines to configuration file (e.g. `prj.conf` or
`board/esp32_devkitc_wrover.conf`):

```cfg
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_SSID="my-wifi"
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_PSK="my-psk"
```

On your host computer open a terminal window, locate the source code of
this sample application (i.e., `examples/zephyr/lightdb/delete`) and
type:

```console
$ west build -b esp32_devkitc_wrover examples/zephyr/lightdb/delete
$ west flash
```

#### nRF52840 DK + ESP32-WROOM-32

This subsection documents using nRF52840 DK running Zephyr with
offloaded ESP-AT WiFi driver and ESP32-WROOM-32 module based board (such
as ESP32 DevkitC rev. 4) running WiFi stack. See [AT Binary
Lists](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-at/en/latest/AT_Binary_Lists/index.html)
for links to ESP-AT binaries and details on how to flash ESP-AT image on
ESP chip. Flash ESP chip with following command:

```console
esptool.py write_flash --verify 0x0 PATH_TO_ESP_AT/factory/factory_WROOM-32.bin
```

Connect nRF52840 DK and ESP32-DevKitC V4 (or other ESP32-WROOM-32 based
board) using wires:

| nRF52840 DK | ESP32-WROOM-32  | ESP32-WROVER-32 |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------|
| P1.01 (RX)  | IO17 (TX)       | IO22 (TX)       |
| P1.02 (TX)  | IO16 (RX)       | IO19 (RX)       |
| P1.03 (CTS) | IO14 (RTS)      | IO14 (RTS)      |
| P1.04 (RTS) | IO15 (CTS)      | IO15 (CTS)      |
| P1.05       | EN              | EN              |
| GND         | GND             | GND             |

Configure the following Kconfig options based on your WiFi AP
credentials:

* GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_SSID - WiFi SSID
* GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_PSK - WiFi PSK

by adding these lines to configuration file (e.g. `prj.conf` or
`board/nrf52840dk_nrf52840.conf`):

```cfg
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_SSID="my-wifi"
CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_PSK="my-psk"
```

On your host computer open a terminal window, locate the source code of
this sample application (i.e., `examples/zephyr/lightdb/delete`) and
type:

```console
$ west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 examples/zephyr/lightdb/delete
$ west flash
```

#### nRF9160 DK

On your host computer open a terminal window, locate the source code of
this sample application (i.e., `examples/zephyr/lightdb/delete`) and
type:

```console
$ west build -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns examples/zephyr/lightdb/delete
$ west flash
```

```

### Set counter value

The device deletes the `/counter` path in LightDB every 5 seconds. The
path (and value) can be created with:

```console
goliothctl lightdb set <device-name> /counter -b "{\"counter\":34}"
```
