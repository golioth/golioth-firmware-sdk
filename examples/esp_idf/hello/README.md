# Hello Example

## Overview

This sample application demonstrates how to connect with Golioth and
publish simple Hello messages.

## Requirements

* Golioth credentials
* Network connectivity

## Building and Running

### Command-line

First, setup the environment. This step assumes you've installed esp-idf
to `~/esp/esp-idf`. If you haven't, follow the initial steps in
examples/esp_idf/README.md

```sh
source ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
```
You may have to set target based on the ESP32 chip you are using.
For example, if you are using ESP32-C3, enter this:

```
idf.py set-target esp32c3
```

Next, `cd` to the hello example where you can build/flash/monitor:

```
cd examples/esp_idf/hello
idf.py build
idf.py flash
idf.py monitor
```
## Adding credentials

After building and flashing this app, you will need to add WiFi and Golioth
credentials using the device shell.

### Shell Credentials

```console
settings set wifi/ssid "YourWiFiAccessPointName"
settings set wifi/psk "YourWiFiPassword"
settings set golioth/psk-id "YourGoliothDevicePSK-ID"
settings set golioth/psk "YourGoliothDevicePSK"
```

Type `reset` to restart the app with the new credentials.
